A module to provide an OpenAPI file from an application,
as well as [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) and [Rapidoc](https://rapidocweb.com/) for displaying OpenAPI.

## Dependency

===! ":fontawesome-brands-java: `Java`"

    Dependency `build.gradle`:
    ```groovy
    implementation "ru.tinkoff.kora:openapi-management"
    ```

    Module:
    ```java
    @KoraApp
    public interface Application extends OpenApiManagementModule { }
    ```

=== ":simple-kotlin: `Kotlin`"

    Dependency `build.gradle.kts`:
    ```groovy
    implementation("ru.tinkoff.kora:openapi-management")
    ```

    Module:
    ```kotlin
    @KoraApp
    interface Application : OpenApiManagementModule
    ```

Requires [HTTP server](http-server.md) module.

## Configuration

An example of the configuration described in the `OpenApiManagementConfig` class:

===! ":material-code-json: `Hocon`"

    ```javascript
    openapi {
        management {
            file = [ "my-openapi-1.yaml", "my-openapi-2.yaml" ] //(1)!
            enabled = false  //(2)!
            endpoint = "/openapi" //(3)!
            swaggerui {
                enabled = false //(4)!
                endpoint = "/swagger-ui" //(5)!
            }
            rapidoc {
                enabled = false //(6)!
                endpoint = "/rapidoc" //(7)!
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    1. Relative path to OpenAPI files in the `resources` directory, either a single file or multiple files can be specified
    2. The on/off switch of the controller that gives the OpenAPI
    3. Path where OpenAPI will be available
        1. If a single OpenAPI file is specified, then represent entire path where file is available
        2. If multiple OpenAPI files are specified, is a path prefix to the file name `/openapi/{fileName}`, taking the specified path and appending the file name to it without the directories and its extension, example of the file `someDirectory/my-openapi-1.yaml` the file path will be `/openapi/my-openapi-1`.
    4. On/Off of the controller that gives SwaggerUI
    5. Path where the SwaggerUI will be accessed
    6. On/Off of the controller that gives Rapidoc
    7. Path where Rapidoc will be available

=== ":simple-yaml: `YAML`"

    ```yaml
    openapi:
      management:
            file = [ "my-openapi-1.yaml", "my-openapi-2.yaml" ] //(1)!
        enabled: false  #(2)!
        endpoint: "/openapi" #(3)!
        swaggerui:
          enabled: false #(4)!
          endpoint: "/swagger-ui" #(5)!
        rapidoc:
          enabled: false #(6)!
          endpoint: "/rapidoc" #(7)!
    ```

## Recommendations

???+ warning "Tip"

    We recommend using [contract first approach](openapi-codegen.md) and generate code using this contract, 
    in this approach same contract file is displayed.

    In the case where the code is first and the contract file is supposed to be created from it, you can use the [Swagger Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/blob/master/modules/swagger-gradle-plugin/README.md).
    together with [Swagger annotation set](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-2.X---Annotations), which will be used to create the contract file.
