Kora is a framework for writing Java / Kotlin applications with a focus on Performance, Efficiency, Transparency.
Kora aims to provide sufficiently high-level declarative tools and abstractions for developers,
which at compile time are translated into hardware-performant and human-readable code.

`Performance` - Kora generates high-performant code at compile time,
avoiding the use of Reflection API in runtime, avoiding dynamic proxies, implements fine-grained abstraction and free aspects.
All this leads to high performance, low response time and handling a large number of requests per second.

`Efficiency` - All facts above and the fact that the dependency container is created
at compile time and initialized as parallel as possible, leads to low startup time.
This also allows effectively use horizontal scaling practices
and maximize resource utilization not only within the application, but also within the entire cluster.

`Transparency` - Kora generates human-readable source code at compile time 
with fine-grained abstractions and free aspects, which leads to high readability of code
and a developer's understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the framework if required with no black box effect.
Kora implies exactly one most effective solution per problem, which brings clarity and understanding to the development team.
This approach also allow to achieve compatibility with GraalVM out of the box and validate the dependency container at compile time.

Kora provides all the tools needed for modern Java/Kotlin development:

- Dependency injection and inversion at compile time via annotations
- Declarative components generation at compile time via annotations
- Aspect-oriented programming via annotations
- Pre-configurable integration modules
- Easy and rapid testing with [JUnit5](documentation/junit5.md)
- Simple, clear and detailed documentation backed by [service examples](examples/kora-examples.md)
