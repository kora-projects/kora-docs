Introduction to Kora is recommended to start with [Hello World example](hello-world.md) with explanations,
which shows the basics of setting up a project and creating a primitive example of a service.

A large number of service examples using various Kora modules can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/kora-projects/kora-examples).

Lots of examples of working with [HTTP server](../documentation/http-server.md), [HTTP client](../documentation/http-client.md),
[database](../documentation/database-common.md), [Kafka](../documentation/kafka.md), [OpenAPI codegen](../documentation/openapi-codegen.md), and various other Kora modules.

Each example service is accompanied by tests that can be used to verify the service's working properly and 
to see how to write primitive tests for certain functionality, both using [JUnit 5 extension](../documentation/junit5.md) 
and in black-box format via [TestContainers](https://java.testcontainers.org/#about-testcontainers-for-java).
